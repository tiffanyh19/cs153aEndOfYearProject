My app helps users keep track of their water intake over the week. They can keep track of the
amount of water they drink each day by going to the day and increasing the amount (in ounces)
in the tracker. My tracker can track the user's water intake for the current week and the past
week.


If I had more time, I would like to have figured out how to integrate the calendar into the water
tracker such that only the current day is shown on display (Tuesday, 7.10.2023 for example)
rather than the whole week. It would also have been nice to figure out how to track the water
intake of the given month rather than just the current week and past week. Otherwise, I think I
had the right mindset going into the project. :)
